# Contact form

The contact form makes use of [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com). To make it work you'll need to create an .env file in the root directory with the following credentials:

REACT_APP_EMAILJS_USER={{ your user ID }}
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE={{ your template ID }}

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
