# Personal Portfolio by Edwin Neef

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# How to use

The state of the application is determined in appState.tsx. Here you can alter the data to your wishes. You can add, edit or remove sections as you please. Also, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions! :)

# Contact form

The contact form makes use of [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com). To make it work you'll need to create a .env file in the root directory with the following credentials:

REACT_APP_EMAILJS_USER={{ your user ID }}<br />
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE={{ your template ID }}
